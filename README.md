## Technical Implementation

### Audio Coordination System

The application uses a custom event system to ensure only one audio source plays at a time:

1. **Custom Events**: Both AudioContext and YouTubePlayerContext dispatch `audioPlayerStarted` events
2. **Cross-Context Communication**: Each context listens for events from the other and stops playback accordingly
3. **Seamless Switching**: Users can switch between sections without manual intervention

### Auto-play Logic

- **Discover Section**: Uses a timer-based system (3.5 minutes) to automatically advance to the next track
- **Songs Section**: Uses the HTML5 audio `ended` event to trigger next track playback
- **User Control**: Both sections provide toggle controls to enable/disable auto-play
